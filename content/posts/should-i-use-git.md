<h1><em><strong>Yes</strong></em></h1>
This isn't even a question in this day and age....  <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is used throughout the world as the main vehicle for version control bar none.  For anyone that needs a source: https://rhodecode.com/insights/version-control-systems-2016

<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with efficiency</a>.  Once it is learned it very quick to use.  Developers can seamlessly work locally and push changes to a remote for a collaborative workflow.  The only disadvantage is the learning curve.  Git commands aren't the most natural and there are <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">a lot of them</a>, some being much more obscure than others.

NO. Git is NOT unusable on Windows anymore as there are many git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows">visual clients</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">command line installations</a>

NO. Git is now integrated with a lot of major IDE for visual exploration  Googling <code>git &lt;your favorite IDE&gt;</code> will likely get you a useful result

I am of the opinion that learning git will even allow you to pick any other Version Control System ( VCS ) whether be <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>, <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>, or god forbid <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/clearcase">ClearCase</a> because of its similarities yet deeper learning curve for concepts of version control.

TL;DR If you're not familiar with Git. Go learn it <strong>now</strong>.
